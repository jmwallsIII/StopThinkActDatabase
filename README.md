C# console app stop.think.act 

Hello my name is, John Walls III!
***
My project is a C# Console app that takes user input and logs it to a file.  I got the idea for this app from a common practice
that we do at my current job which is to fill out a card whenever we see an unsafe act or 
unsafe work condition.  So I thought to myself why not make a console application to simplify and
alleviate the unecessary paper trail.  In my console app I have included the following 3+ features:

**-Implementation of a master loop**

**-Read data fromm an external file, and use the data in the app**

**-Created an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent**

**-Implemented a log that records important events and writes them to a text file**

**-Created a list populated with several values, retrieved values from list and displayed in program**
***
**Beneficial Information**

The txt file opens deep inside the bin folder, I added comments in my source code to identify the general area where I display my interpretaion of the required features.
